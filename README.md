# eduncan911's dot files for Linux distros

This repo contains the dot files across various machines that I run Linux on.  Feel free to grab any portion to use at will.

# Branches

I use branches to retain customizations on a per machine basis.  You will want to review the list below for branch information (the READMEs don't always exist in the branches).
